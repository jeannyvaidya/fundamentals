##How The Web Works


Before we tell the computer what to do, it's important we understand what it is we will be manipulating. You're probably used to seeing a graphical representation of files and folders as icons in a list or in columns.

Let’s get started today with the fundamentals: What, exactly, is the web? How does it work?
Where are all these great websites stored, and how are we able to access them?

In this video, we’ll explain the basic building blocks of the web. Some terms may sound familiar. Others may be brand new. Don’t worry,­ we’ll review everything.  

We’ll start at the beginning: What is the internet? Are the web and the internet the same thing? What’s the difference?

The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In fact, that’s where it gets its name: interconnected network or internet.

And that’s a basic introduction to how the web works. Don’t worry if you still have questions. We’ll review some of the terms in our Tech Speak video section, and your mentor can help with any further questions you have.
